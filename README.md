## 🕸️ Project Description

In this Vue 3 Course from scratch from the Vue School, I have learned how to use Vue.js in a small real project. Vue.js is a modern, flexible, elegant, minimalist and easy-to-learn JavaScript framework, so learning Vue from scratch is one of the best professional decisions I could make.

During the course, I have learned what Vue is, how Vue works and what its new features are, and I have been able to:

• Create projects with Vue 3.

• Use asynchronous JavaScript with Vue.

• Understand reactivity in Vue.

• Use the improvements of Vue 3.

• Manage methods and events in Vue.

• Perform conditional rendering.

• Use dynamic attributes.

• Work with directives.

• Handle dynamic styles and classes.

• Manage the application state.

• Work with data persistence.

• Use transitions in Vue.

• Create and work with Vue components.

At the end of the course, I have mastered the basics of the framework and I am ready to continue learning.

## 🚀 Technologies

During the course, I have used the following technologies:

• Vue.js as a JavaScript framework.

• HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the user interface and information presentation.

• Visual Studio Code as an IDE for code development.

• Git as a version control tool.
