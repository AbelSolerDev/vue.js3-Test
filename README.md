## 🕸️ Project Description

In this Vue 3 Course from scratch from the Vue School, I have learned how to use Vue.js in a small real project. Vue.js is a modern, flexible, elegant, minimalist and easy-to-learn JavaScript framework, so learning Vue from scratch is one of the best professional decisions I could make.

During the course, I have learned what Vue is, how Vue works and what its new features are, and I have been able to:

<ul>
  <li>• Create projects with Vue 3.</li>
  <li>• Use asynchronous JavaScript with Vue.</li>
  <li>• Understand reactivity in Vue.</li>
  <li>• Use the improvements of Vue 3.</li>
  <li>• Manage methods and events in Vue.</li>
  <li>• Perform conditional rendering.</li>
  <li>• Use dynamic attributes.</li>
  <li>• Work with directives.</li>
  <li>• Handle dynamic styles and classes.</li>
  <li>• Manage the application state.</li>
  <li>• Work with data persistence.</li>
  <li>• Use transitions in Vue.</li>
  <li>• Create and work with Vue components.</li>
</ul>

At the end of the course, I have mastered the basics of the framework and I am ready to continue learning.

## 🚀 Technologies

During the course, I have used the following technologies:

<ul>
  <li>• Vue.js as a JavaScript framework.</li>
  <li>• HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the user interface and information presentation.</li>
